	<h1>My Favorite Person</h1>

	<p>At first I was confused,<br>
	confused on what I love<br>
	or whom I love.</p>

	<p>But as I saw a video<br>
	that make my heart flutter,<br>
	feel a butterfly in my stomach,<br>
	and make my smile go wider,<br>
	<span class="highlight">It is you.</span></p>

	<p>There is no doubt in my mind<br>
	when I say you are my<br>
	<span class="highlight">favorite person.</span></p>

	<p>There is nobody's smiles that<br>
	warms my heart like yours.<br>
	There is nobody's laugh that<br>
	i'd rather listen to. Nobody's<br>
	eyes I would rather get lost<br>
	in. There is nobody I would<br>
	rather spend hours on the<br>
	phone with until 3am.</p>

	<p>You feel like home. I never<br>
	knew someone could make<br>
	me feel more comfortable<br>
	with just a touch or calm my<br>
	overthinking with just a glance<br>
	but you do. I am so grateful<br>
	to have you in my life.<br>
	<span class="highlight">I love you.</span></p>
